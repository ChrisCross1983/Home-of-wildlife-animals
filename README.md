# Design

## Color Scheme
The main idea of building the color scheme was to visualize a warm atmosphere that fits the African culture. For the navigation bar the choise comes to a cool, calming shade of blue that conveys a feeling of confidence and stability. The main text is represented by an earthy tone of African savannahs and landscapes. The sections in the body are seperated by a smooth white line and the used color creates a welcoming and calming atmosphere. The footer symbolized by and green hue symbolizes the vegetation of african bush and dschungles. To ensure good contrast and accessibility, some text areas are written in white. This choice was made because the main color scheme does not have combinations that pass the contrast test.

## Typography

Two types of fonts were chosen for this website: "Roboto" and "Lora". The choice of these fonts enhances both readability and aesthetic appel. Roboto, with his clean and modern design, was used for the headings and action buttons. Lora adds a touch of classic refinement to the body text and the menu bar. For better readability and depth, the logo, menu bar and contact form are highlighted by a text shadow. Togehter, these fonts create a harmonious balance between modernity and tradition, perfectly complementing the warm and natural color scheme oft the website.

## Wireframes

The design and structure for this website was created with balsamiq. The designs produced were low fidelity wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile version. The final designs and structure differ from the wireframes due to developments during the construction of the website.

## Site Structure

Home of wild animals consists of 5 page website with 4 pages that the user can navigate between via the navigation bar. The  page is the default loading page. The Logo is on the left side and is also linked to the Home Page. On the right hand site of the logo are four navigation links of [Home](index.html), [Projects](projects.html), [Support](support.html) and [Contact](contact.html). The only hidden page is the ["Thank You" page](thankyou.html), which appears when the user completes and submits the form on the contact page. Until the screen size of 768px the user can navigate through a burger icon, which hides the navigation links for better vibility.
