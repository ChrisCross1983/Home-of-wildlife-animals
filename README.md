# Design

## Color Scheme
The main idea of building the color scheme was to visualize a warm atmosphere that fits the African culture. The navigation bar features a calming shade of blue for confidence and stability. The main text is represented by an earthy tone of African savannahs and landscapes. The sections in the body are seperated by a smooth white line and the used color creates a welcoming and calming atmosphere. The footer symbolized by and green hue symbolizes the vegetation of african bush and dschungles. To ensure good contrast and accessibility, some text areas are written in white. This choice was made because the main color scheme does not have combinations that pass the contrast test.

![Image Color Scheme](readme-images/pp1_color_scheme.png)

## Typography

Two types of fonts were chosen for this website: "Roboto" and "Lora". The choice of these fonts enhances both readability and aesthetic appel. Roboto, with its clean and modern design, was used for the headings and action buttons. Lora adds a touch of classic refinement to the body text and the menu bar. For better readability and depth, the logo, menu bar and contact form are highlighted by a text shadow. Togehter, these fonts create a harmonious balance between modernity and tradition, perfectly complementing the warm and natural color scheme oft the website.

## Wireframes

The design and structure for this website was created with balsamiq. The designs produced were low fidelity wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile version. The final designs and structure differ from the wireframes due to developments during the construction of the website.

## Site Structure

Home of wild animals consists of a 5-page website with 4 pages that the user can navigate between via the navigation bar. The  page is the default loading page. The Logo is on the left side and is also linked to the Home Page. On the right-hand site of the logo are four navigation links: [Home](index.html), [Projects](projects.html), [Support](support.html) and [Contact](contact.html). The only hidden page is the ["Thank You" page](thankyou.html), which appears when the user completes and submits the form on the contact page. Until the screen size of 768px the user can navigate through a burger icon, which hides the navigation links for better visibility. When clicked, the menu bar opens straight down to the bottom of the logo and shows the available options to choose from.

# Features

## Navigation

* The navigation menu is featured at the top of the page and contains the links to main content.

* The logo is on the left in the navigation bar and is clickable and links back to the homepage.

* There are four variations of the navigation bar for different screen sizes.

* For a good user experience the design and color style of the menu bar are simple and consistent.

![Mobile Navbar open](readme-images/menu_bar4.png)

## Home Page

* The Home Page is the landing page of the website and the first impression the user will see. It is designed to warmly welcome the user and quickly find out the purpose of the website.

* Initially, there is a large hero image featuring two zebras, accompanied by an emotional quote that aligns with the ethos by which the NGO stands by (this kind of large background image you will find on all sites, the quote also on the projects and support sites) - the chosen styles and hues harmonize with each other and represent a natural atmosphere.

* Followed by a large "About us" header, this section showcases and describes the members behind the organsiation, immediatley building trust with the visitor.

* The same sized "Our Mission" header introduces the section that provides a detailed background on three main fields of voluntary work, giving the user a tangible understanding of the daily operations of an NGO.

* Nearly at the bottom of the page there is a small section that helps the user follow a logical flow and easily navigate to the next page without needing to scroll back to the top.

* Each section is fully responsive, with the multiple column content naturally transitioning into single column content. For better readibility,the headings also scale up with larger screen views.

* The page lists the focus projects in an ordered way categorized in sepearate sections for animals, nature and people.

* The goal of this page is to transparently describe the different projects areas, provide a better understanding of the practical work as a volunteer, and increase interest in choosing a favorite project the user feels connected to. 

* The different color transparencies of the sections and small white borders between and surronding the body of the page make it easy for the user to visually understand when a new topic starts.

## Support Page

* Thesupport page is the third page, reachable from its link of the navigation bar or as already described from the bottom section of each site.

* The page describes the two ways a user can support the organization, including an easy-to-process "call to action" button for each section. The first button, "I want to help" redirects to the contact page of the website for further steps, while the "I want to donate" button links to an external site (www.paypal.com) to facilitate a donation.

* The goal of this page is to build trust by giving the organization a personal character and explaining why support is a necessary part of ensuring the sustainability and survival of the NGO.

* The different color transparencies of the sections and small white borders between and surronding the body of the page make it easy for the user to visually understand when a new topic starts.

* Nearly at the bottom of the page there is again a small section that helps the user follow a logical flow and easily navigate to the next page (or to the previous) without needing to scroll back to the top.

* Each section is fully responsive, with the multiple column content naturally transitioning into single column content. For better readibility, headings, buttons and text also scale up with larger screen view.

## Contact Page

* The contact page is last visible page on the website, the goal is to turn the users gained interest into a communication request by using the form.

* The contact form is kept simple and reflects some of the mentioned topics from the previous pages, such as the project areas (animals, humans, nature).

* The design is consitent with the layout of the quote, feauturing three input fields; First Name, Last Name and Email Address. There is also an radio button field with three options; Animals, Nature and People, along with two select fields to choose one of four possible answers for the offered time periods in the categories; Quater and Year.

* The required attribute prevents the user from submitting an incorrect form and ensures that all necessary input fields are filled out.

* The form uses a GET function to link to a Thank You page, mimicking the effect of actually submitting the form. This improves the users visual interaction by displaying a personal message.

* The contact page is fully responsive, for better readibility, headings, buttons and text also scale up with larger screen view.

# Bugs

## Solved Bugs

### HTML Validation

The following errors was presented once the website was placed through W3C HTML Validator.

![W3 Code error](readme-images/w3_code_error.png)

It said that the "a" element must not appear as a descendant ot the "button" element. I removed the button element and add the class selector for creating a button within the a element, it cleared that error up.

![W3 Code error 2](readme-images/w3_code-error_contact.png)

It said that some type attribute had a bad value "name" and regarding this issue it was not allowed to use the "required" attribute in the input elements. I changed the wrong value from name to "text" and it cleared that error up.

![W3 Code error 3](readme-images/w3_code-error_thankyou.png)

It said that the a section lack heading was found.  deleted the section due to the unused id selector "filler" and it cleared that error up.

![Wave Error](readme-images/wave_error_empty_label.png)

It said that there is a "empty" form label found in the header regarding thenav toggle bar. Becaus there is not text intended I add an aria-hidden="true" to the i element and copy / paste it to all the other html sites, it cleared that error up. 
  
### Lighthouse Testing

Due to the first Lighthouse report, I struggled with the "mobile perfomance" and tried to find some help online. I found this site [web.dev](https://web.dev/articles/optimize-lcp?hl=de), which helped me fix this issue.

![Lovelight Mobile Perfomance before](readme-images/first_lovelight_audit.png)

  1. First I converted the format of all images to webp and resize them using the tool [cloudconvert](https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-webp).
  2. Then, I moved the "Google Import Fonts" from the style.css file to the HTML file.
  3. I also added the attribute loading="lazy" to all body images, so they load only when the user scrolls to them.
  4. Finally, I added the attribute "async" to the script element for the FontAwesome navigation bar icon, to speed up the website by loading the fonts in parallel with the rest of the site.

These changes raise the perfomance to at least a value of 80.
